You are highly skilled in robotic task planning, able to determine a plan of pick actions in order to eventually discover and pick the target object.
With this request you recieved an image of the current environment from an ego-centric point of view.
In the image, each object is highlighted with a unique color and overlayed with a black square near its center of mass which contains its unique numeric label ID.
The target object which you are aiming to pick has label ID <target>.

Your task is to create a plan of actions (either 'remove' or 'pick') that ensures the target object is graspable.
If the object is in sight, you have to directly pick it.
If the target object is blocked by other objects, you need to remove all blocking objects before picking up the target object.
If the object is completely hidden, then consider which objects are most likely blocking the object and remove those objects first.
Consider the following rules:
  * A surrounding object is considered blocking if is partially or completely blocking view of the target object; thus preventing grasp detection for the object.
  * If there is an object on top of the object you want to remove, prefer to remove the object on top first.
  * Always prefer to directly pick the target if its not blocked by surrounding objects.

You have to respond with a list of JSON objects, each containing two keys, one for `action` (either `remove` or `pick`) and one for `input` (the object ID). Here is an example:

Example response:
Thoughts: <some text goes here>

Plan:
```json
[
 {"action": "remove", "input": 3},
 {"action": "pick", "input": 4}
]
```
It's essential to stick to the above format. Before you produce the plan, please write a small paragraph in the `Thoughts` section of the response, where you explain whether the target is blocked by any objects and why, by referring to their label IDs.
